## Scripts
### SeekDeep
All commands to run `SeekDeep v2.6.0` are in the *SeekDeep Directory* within the `uganda_seekdeep.py` [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) file. 
Sample names, molecular identification barcodes, primers and pools are listed within the text files.   

### Statistics
All statistical analysis are in the *R Directory* and are contained with the markdown files: `Uganda_DrugRx_NFB_v3.Rmd`. The
`Uganda_DrugRx_NFB_v3.Rmd` calls NFBtools, which is a personal suite of functions located [here](https://github.com/nickbrazeau/NFBtools).
